### 2. Goal
To predict the final price of each home using 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

<br>

### 3. Methodology & Summary

  + LASSO regressions showed the best performance with a cross validation RMSE-score of 0.1121. Although there is a lot of multicollinearity among the variables, LASSO regression include feature selection; it does not select a substantial number of the available variables in its model, as it is supposed to do.
  + The XGBoost model also performs very well with a cross validation RMSE of 0.1162.
  + As those two algorithms are very different, averaging predictions is likely to improve the predictions. As the Lasso cross validated RMSE is better than XGBoost's CV score, I decided to weight the Lasso results double.
